# Prepare and Submit Your Resume

You will probably get your job through networking and not through submitting your resume through online submits BUT your resume will still need to meet industry expectations of a professional and be ready to share with potential employers. 

## Assignment

Follow these steps on how to create, refine, and upload your resume: 
 
1. Choose a preferred template from one of these [pre-approved templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f2dnx38bZdBwgzynjc374T_EKgQkYPCO){:target="_blank"}.
  
1. Make a copy of the template (under "File - make a copy") that you would like to use and put it into your “my drive” in your Google.docs. Rename the document using this naming convention “Jane Jackson - Resume”. 

1. Following [this example](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JlbA8PBqRfC_Nj4hpyduIlPUar8YjT-GzgvSCaojojA/edit){:target="_blank"} that outlines the approved standard resume. Fill out the template with your information or copy and paste from a prior resume with updated information. 

1. When all template edits are complete, follow these steps in order. 
    1. Click the blue share button at the top right of the doc.
    
    1. Click on "Advanced"
    
    1. Now enter the resume reviewer's email (provided in the Canvas assignment) in the field under "Invite people:"
        - After your resume reviewer receives the invite to edit your resume, they will make a copy of it becoming the new "owner" and adding you as an editor. This allows us to store your resume in our Drive that is shared with our hiring partners.
        
    1. Under "Owner Settings" you will see a check-mark "preventing editors from changing access and adding new people". Make sure you **un-check** this!
        - It will then tell you "you've made changes you need to save". Click the blue "Save changes" button.
        
    1. You should see that "Notify people" **is** checked. Now click the pencil icon. Verify that "Can edit" **is** checked. Click the blue "Send" button.
    
    1. Once you have been made editor (could take several days) of the new resume stored in our database, remove the reviewer's email from sharing rights to your original resume! This eliminates the risk of having duplicate resumes being edited from both parties. 
    
**Please save the version you receive back from the resume reviewer for future edits and collaboration.**
