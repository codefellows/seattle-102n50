this is where my function notes go:

- naming convention: name implies functionality or use  one word - camelCase
- declaration: when the function is defined / when the logic is created / entire function created
- parameters: a special type of variable  created and used in a specific function
- arguements: when you casll your function you pass values as arguements, and those arguements take the place of your parameters
- return statement: manages output
- local variables: variable declared INSIDE a function
- global variables: variables cfreated in the GLOBAL namespace, ot outside of functions

General:  `document.write()` given for free. takes input, does some processing, returns output

when to use return.  for now always, unless you know otherwise
